## Constraints and Assumptions
It only works functionally on the iOS system but not on the Android system. However, it is still readable on the Android system but can not edit information. Also, it is not compatible on a website, it only works on the mobile app. The possible external software packages of the system can depend on API. System assumptions is iOS based.
  
## External Interface Requirements
There will be many types of interfaces for this app. One will be for the user to login securely. Another would be for setting up appointments for the doctors. One for the prescriptions and medications that the customer will take. Another for the calendar with two sections: one for appointments, and the other for medications to take on those days.

## Performance Requirements
The app’s performance will be dependent on IOS software which will be coded on X code. It can also be dependent on API’s to get information about the customer.

## Design Constraints
Some external requirements that will constrain our design choices will be how understandable the app will be, meaning it shouldn’t be so complex that only younger people are able to use the app. The app should be very simple and will only be two language supportive: English and Spanish. 
  
## Quality Requirements
The users could expect an improvement in their health treatment response since they will have their necessary information on hand. This system could be considered life-critical since it will prevent the users from accidental overdose of their prescriptions, or forgetting to take a really important medication such as high blood pressure medication or chemotherapy.

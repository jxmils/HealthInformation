# Health Information Application System Design

## Design Architecture - Layered

### How the Layered Architecture Compliments our Design
The layered architecture fit our system best since we decided to implement the application by sections. Since our application supported multiple user active interfaces, we felt it was best to implement these in parts, and then connect said parts with the rest of the system. Another key to the implementing a layered architecture was our application using constant interfacing with the user, we have to constantly receive input, store that information and output corresponding information. The layered architecture allowed us to seperate our system into three components, or layers, the Presentation layer, Persistence layer, and Database layer. <br>
